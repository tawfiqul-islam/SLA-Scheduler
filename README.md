A scheduling framework implemented on top of Apache Mesos. Two greedy heuristic-based algorithm is implemented in the scheduling framework. In addition, an Integer Linear Programming (ILP) based approach has also been implemented to solve the executor placement problem in the scheduler.

The outcome of this work is under review and titled as "Cost-efficient Dynamic Scheduling of Big Data Applications
in Apache Spark on Cloud".
